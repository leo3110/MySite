      I can't say for sure what I am right now, but I can say I love coding and web is my favourite stuff.
      Since 2016 I'm studying to become a developer. I have a good eye for errors, my logic is... awesome, i think? and I
      want to create/work on good systems, with usefull functions and make it user-friendly. I REALLY, REALLY love coding,
      and the experience of looking to that interface, click everyewhere and realise that it's working properly, that is
      so satisfying.

      Leaving the work aside, I like games, coffee, eletronic music and stay awake late night. I'm not much into, but I
      enjoy series and movies, mostly the exquisite ones. Sometimes I take pictures of random things that seems to be
      interesting to take an aesthetic shot. Usually I don't go out too much, but i miss my high school friends, and
      wish I still had their contact... ANYWAY, NO SADNESS ALLOWED HERE!

      Hope you like my webpage, it's made in my free time, and I think that may be a bunch of errors around. ENJOY.
